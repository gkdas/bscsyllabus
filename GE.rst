Learning objective
------------------

-  Predict relative energies and locations of frontier molecular
   orbitals for organic molecules of intermediate complexity using
   linear combinations of atomic orbitals and hybridized orbital
   approaches.

-  Use reaction kinetics, linear free energy relationships, isotope
   labeling, stereo-electronic effects and stereochemical outcomes to
   determine reaction mechanisms.

-  Predict reaction mechanisms of major classes of organic reactions,
   including substitutions, eliminations, additions and radical
   reactions.

-  Recognize the impact of non-covalent interactions in complex systems
   and reaction mechanisms.

-  Calculate optical purity and enantiomeric excess.

-  Draw all the stereoisomers of organic compounds, and recognise
   diastereomers, enantiomers, meso compounds and centres of symmetry.

-  Recognise and discuss the stereoisomers of chiral compounds that do
   not contain a stereogenic carbon centre and assign the configuration
   of the stereoisomers.

-  Explain and predict the stereochemical outcome of organic reactions
   by considering the reaction mechanism.

-  Perform the synthesis, separation and characterisation of organic
   compounds in the laboratory and report and discuss the results of
   experiments using the appropriate technical language.
