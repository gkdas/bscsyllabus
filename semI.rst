Learning Objective
------------------

1. To make a connection between shape and electronic structure of molecule

2. To predict the basic structural effects like inductive, steric and 
resonance effect

3. To predict the reactivity of the molecule with other reagents

4. To represent the movement of electrons in bond breaking and bond making
processes by curely arrows

5. To classify the reactions as the combination of some fundamental 
processes like substitution, addition and elimination steps.

6. To predict a relatively complex mechanism of some unknown reaction

7. To gain knowledge on the basic 3-D structure of a molecule

8. To relate the 3-D structure with its optical properties.

9. To gain knowledge on the stereoisomerism.

Learning outcome
----------------

At the end of this course the students can correlate the electronic structure
of a specific geometry of a molecule. He can also predict the reactivity on
the basis of it structural properties. He also gain knowledge on how to draw
reaction mechanism and divide a complete reaction on several elementary steps.
He do also have an idea on the 3-D structure and the related properties of
a molecule.
