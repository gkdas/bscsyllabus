1. Compute the optimized CC bond length in ethane, ethene, ethyne,
and benzene. Visualize the Molecular Orbitals of ethane sigma bonds
and ethene, ethyne, benzene and pyridine pi bonds. 

	- Perform and conformational analysis of butane

	- Determine the enthalpy of isomerization of ** cis ** and
	  ** trans ** -butene

2. Visualize the electron density and electrostatic potential map of
LiH, HF, N /sub 2 /sub, NO and CO and comment. Relate to the Dipole
moments. Animate the vibrations of these molecules.

3. 
	- Relate the charge on the hydrogen atom of hydrogen halides
          with their acid character.

	- Compare the basicities of nitrogen atoms of ammonia, 
	  methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine.

	- Compare the shapes of the molecule 1-butanol, 2-butanol,
	  1-methyl-1-propanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol. Note the dipole
	  moment of each molecule.

	- Show how the shapes affect the trend in boiling points.

		- 118, 108, 100, 82 respectively.


4. Build and optimize organic compounds of your choice containing the
following functional groups. Note the dipole moment of each compound

	- alkyl halide

	- aldehyde

	- ketone

	- amine

	- ether

	- nitrile

	- thiol

	- carboxylic acid

	- ester

	- amide


#. 
	- Determine the heat of hydration of ethylene

	- Compute the resonance energy of benzene by compparison
	  of its ethalpy of hydrogenation with that of cyclohexene.

#. Arrange 1-hexene, 2-methyl-2-pentene, (E)-3-methyl-2-pentene,
(Z)-3-methyl-2-pentene and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene in order of increasing
stability.

#. Compare the optimized bond angles of H2O, H2S, H2Se. Compute the HAH
bond angles for the second row dihydrides and compare with the results
from qualitative MO theory.
