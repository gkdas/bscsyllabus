Friedlanderâ€™s synthesis, Knorr quinoline synthesis, Doebner- Miller
synthesis, Bischler-Napieralski reaction, Pictet-Spengler reaction,
Pomeranz-Fritsch Reaction; Derivatives of furan: Furfural and furoic
acid.

**Learning Outcome:**

-  Heterocyclic compounds are very interesting due to their distinct
   structure and the availability of this kind of heterocyclic
   structures in medicinal drugs.

-  So the technique of synthesis of heterocyclic compounds is important
   in the synthesis of different drugs.

-  The course aims at giving a fundamental theoretical understanding of
   heterocyclic chemistry, including alternative general methods for
   ring synthesis and application of such methods for the preparation of
   specific groups of heterocyclic systems.

-  Moreover, it gives the quantitative ideas about the synthesis,
   properties and uses of such heterocyclic compounds like pyrole,
   pyridine qunolene, thiophene, furan etc.

-  The student will get familiar with particular properties and
   reactions for the most important heterocycles as well as different
   systems of nomenclature.
